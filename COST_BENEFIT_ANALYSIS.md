## ROI Calculation

### Return on Investment

**Investment:** Choosing Auth0 SDK requires upfront decision and migration effort

**Returns:** $168,900 saved over 3 years

**ROI Calculation:**

```
ROI = (Savings - Investment) / Investment × 100%

Migration effort: $5,000 (if migrating from custom)
Savings: $168,900

ROI = ($168,900 - $5,000) / $5,000 × 100%
    = 3,278%
```

**Payback Period:** Less than 1 month (savings exceed migration cost immediately)

## Sensitivity Analysis

### If Hourly Rate Changes

| Rate | Custom 3-Year TCO | Auth0 3-Year TCO | Savings | % Savings |
|------|-------------------|------------------|---------|-----------|
| **$100/hr** | $146,800 | $34,200 | $112,600 | 77% |
| **$150/hr** | $220,200 | $51,300 | $168,900 | 77% |
| **$200/hr** | $293,600 | $68,400 | $225,200 | 77% |
| **$250/hr** | $367,000 | $85,500 | $281,500 | 77% |

**Conclusion:** Savings percentage remains constant (~77%) across all reasonable hourly rates.

### If Auth0 Pricing Changes

**Current:** Auth0 is free for up to 7,000 MAU (Monthly Active Users)

**What if Auth0 charges?**

| Scenario | Annual Auth0 Cost | Custom 3-Year TCO | Auth0 3-Year TCO | Still Cheaper? |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Current (Free)** | $0 | $220,200 | $51,300 | ✅ Yes ($168,900 savings) |
| **Small charge** | $5,000/year | $220,200 | $66,300 | ✅ Yes ($153,900 savings) |
| **Medium charge** | $10,000/year | $220,200 | $81,300 | ✅ Yes ($138,900 savings) |
| **Large charge** | $20,000/year | $220,200 | $111,300 | ✅ Yes ($108,900 savings) |
| **Break-even** | $56,300/year | $220,200 | $220,200 | ⚖️ Equal |

**Conclusion:** Auth0 would need to charge **$56,300/year** before custom becomes cheaper. This is highly unlikely for authentication services.
