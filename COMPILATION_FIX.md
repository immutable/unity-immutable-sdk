# Compilation Error Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Issue:** CS0246 errors - PassportException not found in Auth0NativeManager.cs

---

## Problem

```
error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'PassportException' could not be found
(are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
```

**Affected File:** `src/Packages/Passport/Runtime/Scripts/Private/Auth0NativeManager.cs`

**Lines with Errors:**
- Line 119: `throw new PassportException(...)`
- Line 149: `TrySetException(new PassportException(...))`
- Line 165: `TrySetException(new PassportException(...))`
- Line 177: `TrySetException(new PassportException(...))`

---

## Root Cause

**Missing using directive in Auth0NativeManager.cs**

`PassportException` is defined in the `Immutable.Passport.Model` namespace, but Auth0NativeManager.cs was missing:
```csharp
using Immutable.Passport.Model;
```

---

## Solution Applied

**File:** `src/Packages/Passport/Runtime/Scripts/Private/Auth0NativeManager.cs`

**Change:**
```diff
  using System;
  using UnityEngine;
  using Cysharp.Threading.Tasks;
+ using Immutable.Passport.Model;

  #if UNITY_ANDROID && !UNITY_EDITOR
  using UnityEngine.Android;
  #endif
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## Verification

The fix is identical to how `Passport.cs` imports PassportException:

**Passport.cs (line 15):**
```csharp
using Immutable.Passport.Model;  // ✓ Has this
```

**Auth0NativeManager.cs (now line 4):**
```csharp
using Immutable.Passport.Model;  // ✓ Added this
```

---

## Why This Happened

When I initially created Auth0NativeManager.cs, I forgot to add this using directive. The file was created from scratch and didn't have all the necessary imports copied from similar files.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Compilation Error Fixed** (Complete)
2. ⏳ **Rebuild in Unity** (Should compile cleanly now)
3. ⏳ **Build APK** (Follow BUILD_AND_TEST_GUIDE.md)
4. ⏳ **Test on Device**

---

## Files Modified

```bash
M  src/Packages/Passport/Runtime/Scripts/Private/Auth0NativeManager.cs
```

**Total Changes:** +1 line (added using directive)

---

**Status:** ✅ **Ready to build in Unity**

The compilation errors should be resolved. Try building again in Unity.
