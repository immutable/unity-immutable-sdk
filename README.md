# Immutable Unity SDK

## Prerequisites

- [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/): since `.dll` files are stored on Git Large File Storage, you must download and install git-lfs from [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## Supported Platforms

<li>Windows (64-bit)</li>
<li>Android (minimum version 5.1)</li>
<li>iOS (minimum version 13.0)</li>

## Registering your game

Before using Passport, you must register your application as an OAuth 2.0 **Native** client in the [Immutable Developer Hub](https://hub.immutable.com). First, you'll need to create a project and a testnet environment.
Then you can navigate to the Passport config screen and create a passport client for your created environment.
When you're ready to launch your application on the mainnet,
please ensure you configure a passport client under a mainnet environment.

See [here](https://docs.immutable.com/docs/x/passport/register-application) for more details.

## Installation

1. Clone the [unity-immutable-sdk](https://github.com/immutable/unity-immutable-sdk) repository or download the zip/tarball from one of the versions [here](https://github.com/immutable/unity-immutable-sdk/tags)
2. Open the Package Manager
3. Click the add + button and select "Add package from disk..."
4. Navigate to the Passport package root folder (`src/Packages/Passport`)
5. Double-click the `package.json` file

## Quick Start

### Initialise Passport

Create a script with the following code and bind it to an object:

```csharp
public class ImmutableUnity : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        Passport passport = await Passport.Init("YOUR_IMMUTABLE_CLIENT_ID");
    }
}
```

Passport is now accessible from anywhere via `Passport.Instance`.

### Connect to Passport

We use the [Device Code Authorisation](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/device-authorization-flow#:~:text=Your%20Auth0%20Authorization%20Server%20redirects,authorized%20to%20access%20the%20API.) flow to authenticate and authorise gamers.

```csharp
await passport.Connect();
```

This will open the gamer's default browser and take them through the auth flow.

#### Credentials

Once the gamer is connected to Passport, the SDK will store your credentials (access, ID, and refresh tokens).

You may use `await passport.ConnectSilent()` to connect to Passport using the saved credentials. This is similar to `Connect()`. However, if the saved access token is no longer valid and the refresh token cannot be used, it will not fall back to the Device Code Authorisation flow.

```csharp
try
{
    bool hasCredsSaved = await passport.HasCredentialsSaved();
    if (hasCredsSaved)
    {
        await passport.ConnectSilent();
        // Successfully connected to Passport
    }
}
catch (Exception)
{
    // Attempted to connect to Passport silently but could not use saved credentials.
    // You may prompt the gamer to connect again (e.g. await passport.Connect())
    // or ignore this error and prompt the gamer to connect at another point.
}
```

### Log out of Passport

```csharp
await passport.Logout();
```

### Immutable X Transfer

> Note: The transfers feature require pre-approval from Immutable. Please reach out to us before making use of it.

An unsigned transfer request for ETH, ERC20 or ERC721 is expected for the ImxTransfer method.

```csharp
UnsignedTransferRequest request = UnsignedTransferRequest.ERC721(
    receiver,
    tokenId,
    tokenAddress
);

CreateTransferResponseV1 response = await passport.ImxTransfer(request);
```

Batch NFT transfers are also supported:

```csharp
NftTransferDetails[] details = {
    new NftTransferDetails(
        receiver1,
        tokenId1,
        tokenAddress1
    ),
    new NftTransferDetails(
        receiver2,
        tokenId2,
        tokenAddress2
    )
};

CreateBatchTransferResponse response = await passport.ImxBatchNftTransfer(details);
```

### Android and iOS PKCE login

For Android and iOS you can use the PKCE login flow instead of Device Code. This means the gamer has one less step to complete and will be redirected back to the game after successfully authenticating.

To use this flow you will need to:

1. Define a deep link scheme for your game (e.g. `mygame://callback`)
2. Login to the [Immutable Developer Hub](https://hub.immutable.com/) and add the deeplink to your clients **Callback URLs** and **Logout URLs**
3. Set this deep link as your redirect URI in the Passport Init:

```C#
Passport passport = await Passport.Init("YOUR_IMMUTABLE_CLIENT_ID", "mygame://callback");
```

4. Call `try { await ConnectPKCE(); } catch(Exception) { ... }` instead of `Connect()`
5. Follow the Android and iOS setup below

#### Android setup

1. In Unity go to **Build Settings** -> **Player Settings** -> **Android** -> **Publishing Settings** -> Enable **Custom Main Manifest** under the **Build** section
2. Open the newly generated `Assets/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest.xml` file
3. Add the following code inside the `<Activity>` element:

```XML
<intent-filter>
  <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
  <data android:scheme="mygame" android:host="callback" />
</intent-filter>
```

The application will now open when the device processes any link that starts with `mygame://callback`.

See the sample's app [AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/immutable/unity-immutable-sdk/blob/main/sample/Assets/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest.xml) for an example.

#### iOS setup

1. In Unity go to **Build Settings** -> **Player Settings** -> **iOS** -> **Other Settings** -> **Supported URL schemes**, increment the **Size** number and include your URL scheme in the **Element** field.

After this set-up, your game can log in using PKCE.
