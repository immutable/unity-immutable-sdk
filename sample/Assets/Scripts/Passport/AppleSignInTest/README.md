## What the Test Script Does

### On Start:
- ‚úÖ Logs platform information
- ‚úÖ Checks for Passport instance
- ‚úÖ Sets up button listeners
- ‚úÖ Shows UNITY_IOS flag status

### When Button Clicked:
- ‚úÖ Logs detailed progress
- ‚úÖ Creates DirectLoginOptions with DirectLoginMethod.Apple
- ‚úÖ Calls Passport.Login()
- ‚úÖ Shows success/failure
- ‚úÖ Navigates to AuthenticatedScene on success

### Log Output:
All actions are logged to:
- Console (Unity Debug.Log)
- On-screen log text (scrollable)
- With timestamps

## Expected Behavior

### In iOS Simulator (without native plugin yet):
```
[00:00:01] AppleSignInTestScript started
[00:00:01] ‚úÖ Passport instance found
[00:00:01] ‚úÖ Apple Sign In button listener added
[00:00:01] Platform: IPhonePlayer
[00:00:01] iOS: True
[00:00:01] Editor: False
[00:00:01] ‚úÖ UNITY_IOS flag is defined
[STATUS] Ready to test Apple Sign In

[User clicks button]

[00:00:05] üçé Apple Sign In button clicked!
[00:00:05] Creating DirectLoginOptions for Apple...
[00:00:05] DirectLoginMethod: Apple
[00:00:05] Calling Passport.Login()...
[00:00:05] [PassportImpl] Login with DirectLoginMethod: Apple
[00:00:05] [PassportUI] Loading WebView...
...
[00:00:10] ‚ùå Login failed (expected - no native implementation yet)
[STATUS] Login Failed
```

### After Native Plugin is Implemented:
```
[00:00:01] AppleSignInTestScript started
[00:00:01] ‚úÖ Passport instance found
[00:00:01] ‚úÖ Apple Sign In button listener added
[00:00:01] ‚úÖ UNITY_IOS flag is defined
[STATUS] Ready to test Apple Sign In

[User clicks button]

[00:00:05] üçé Apple Sign In button clicked!
[00:00:05] Creating DirectLoginOptions for Apple...
[00:00:05] DirectLoginMethod: Apple
[00:00:05] Calling Passport.Login()...
[00:00:05] [AppleSignInAuth] Starting Apple Sign In...
[00:00:06] [iOS Native] Presenting ASAuthorizationController
[00:00:08] [User authenticates with Face ID]
[00:00:10] [AppleSignInAuth] Success! Identity token received
[00:00:11] ‚úÖ Login successful!
[STATUS] Login Successful!
[00:00:13] [Loading AuthenticatedScene]

## Files to Create

You need to create in Unity Editor:
1. Scene: `Assets/Scenes/Passport/AppleSignInTestScene.unity`
2. Canvas with UI elements (follow steps above)
3. AppleSignInTestManager GameObject with script attached

## Quick Setup (Copy-Paste Ready)

If you want to skip manual UI creation, you can:

1. Duplicate `UnauthenticatedScene.unity`
2. Rename to `AppleSignInTestScene.unity`
3. Delete all UI except Canvas and EventSystem
4. Follow "Create UI Elements" steps above
5. Add AppleSignInTestScript
