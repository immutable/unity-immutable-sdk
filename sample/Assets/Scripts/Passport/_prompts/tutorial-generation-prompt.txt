# Passport Feature Group Tutorial Generator
## Task Overview
Analyze the specified {FEATURE_GROUP} from sample/Assets/Scripts/Passport/features.json and create comprehensive documentation for it. You will create:
1. A comprehensive tutorial.md file covering all features in the specified group
2. A metadata.json file for the feature group

## Input Required
- FEATURE_GROUP: The exact name of the specific feature group to document, as it appears in features.json

## Structure of features.json
The features.json file has the following structure:
```json
{
  "features": {
    "{FEATURE_GROUP}": {
      "feature1": { ... },
      "feature2": { ... },
      ...
    },
    "anotherFeatureGroup": {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

You will be analyzing one specific {FEATURE_GROUP} and all features contained within it.

## Special Case: Single-Feature Groups
IMPORTANT: If the specified {FEATURE_GROUP} contains only one feature, treat it as a standalone feature rather than a feature group. This means:
- Do not refer to it as a "feature group" in the documentation
- Skip the "Feature Group Overview" section that discusses relationships between features
- Focus solely on documenting the single feature in depth
- Adjust headings and terminology accordingly to avoid references to a "group"
- For the "Running the Feature Example" section (note: not "Examples"), provide steps specific to this single feature

## Preparation
Before starting:
- Read through all SDK documentation (in the /src/Packages folders)
- Understand the SDK's key features, functionality, and integration patterns
- Focus on the Passport SDK the most. That's your area of specialty.
- Familiarize yourself with the specified feature group defined in features.json

## Process for the Specified Feature Group

### 1. Analysis Phase
- Identify the specified {FEATURE_GROUP} and all member features from features.json
- For each feature in the group, read all C# code files in the feature's directory (sample/Assets/Scripts/Passport/{FeatureName}/)
- Understand how the features in the group relate to each other
- Identify the common patterns, architecture, components, and data flow across the feature group
- Note all frameworks, libraries, and dependencies used
- IMPORTANT: Focus on the logical connections between features in the group while maintaining focus on each feature's specific implementation details.

### 2. Create tutorial.md in sample/Assets/Scripts/Passport/_tutorials/{FEATURE_GROUP}/
Create a tutorial.md file for the feature group with the following structure:

#### Group Introduction
- Brief overview of the feature group's purpose and importance
- Which specific SDK capabilities the group demonstrates
- Link to the sample app GitHub repository. (The Github repository MUST BE linked with this message: "View feature group on Github")

Note: For single-feature cases, rename this section to "Feature Introduction" and adjust the link text to "View feature on Github"

IMPORTANT: The TITLE (the text that starts with #) of the feature group that comes before the "View feature group on Github" link must be wrapped in a <div class="display-none"> tag. Ensure that the format looks like this:
<div class="display-none">

# Group Title

</div>

IMPORTANT: The "View feature group on Github" link must be wrapped in a <div class="button-component"> tag. Ensure that the format looks like this:
<div class="button-component">

[View feature group on Github](<link to the github repo>) <span class="button-component-arrow">→</span>

</div>

IMPORTANT: The feature group's description will come before the "View feature group on Github" link.

#### {FeatureGroup} Overview
- List all features included in this group
- Explain how these features work together and their relationships
- High-level description of common patterns across features in this group

Note: For single-feature cases, skip this section entirely.

#### Unity SDK {FeatureGroup} Features
For each feature in the group, create a section with:

Note: For single-feature cases, rename this section to "Unity SDK {feature} Implementation" and adjust content accordingly.

##### Feature: [Feature Name]
- Brief description of what the specific feature does
- Code snippets showing how the feature is implemented (CodeBlock should be linked to the relevant github repo)
- IMPORTANT: related snippets should be under a single code block rather than dividing them across multiple codeblocks. Only include the relevant snippets (method calls, etc) and not Unity-specific boilerplate (such as Start, Update, etc, when it's irrelevant) to ensure that the focus is on the most important code snippet relevant to the feature.
    - Example structure: ```csharp title="<feature name>" manualLink="<github repo link containing the code snippet(don't specify the line, just the file's link)>"
                                <code snippet>
                        ```
- Clear explanation of how the code works
- When relevant, note how this feature connects with others in the group

#### Running the Feature Group Examples
- Prerequisites (including a link to Immutable Hub for environment setup)
- Step-by-step instructions to run all features in the group locally (using Unity Editor)
- Note any sequence dependencies (if certain features should be run before others)

Note: For single-feature cases, rename this section to "Running the Feature Example" and adjust the content accordingly.

#### Summary
- Concise recap of what the feature group demonstrates
- Best practices when using these features together
- Any key takeaways for developers

#### Formatting Requirements
- Use proper Markdown syntax throughout
- Use heading levels (H1, H2, H3, H4) appropriately
- Format all code with proper syntax highlighting
- Use bulleted lists for features and steps
- Include clear transitions between different features in the group

### 3. Create metadata.json in sample/Assets/Scripts/Passport/_tutorials/{FEATURE_GROUP}/
IMPORTANT: UI LIBRARY IS NOT A FEATURE OR TECH STACK. IN GENERAL, NEVER INCLUDE UI LIBRARY IN THE METADATA.JSON FILE.
Create a metadata.json file for the feature group with the following structure:
{
"title": "[Descriptive title of the feature group]",
"description": "[Concise overview of what the feature group demonstrates]",
"keywords": ["Immutable", "SDK", "[Feature Group]", "[Feature 1]", "[Feature 2]", ...],
"tech_stack": ["Unity", "C#", "[Library]", ...],
"product": "Passport",
"programming_language": "C#"
}

For single-feature cases, use this structure instead:
{
"title": "[Descriptive title of the feature]",
"description": "[Concise overview of what the feature demonstrates]",
"keywords": ["Immutable", "SDK", "[Feature Name]", ...],
"tech_stack": ["Unity", "C#", "[Library]", ...],
"product": "Passport",
"programming_language": "C#"
}

### 4. Handling Existing Files
If the feature group already has tutorial.md or metadata.json but is incomplete:
- Enhance the content while preserving any accurate existing information
- Ensure it meets all the format requirements specified above
- Update to include all features in the group according to the latest features.json

## Final Verification
- All features in the specified feature group are documented thoroughly in tutorial.md
- The tutorial shows the logical connections between features in the group
- The tutorial is free of generic SDK initialization boilerplate
- All links to GitHub repositories are correct
- metadata.json contains accurate and comprehensive information covering all features in the group
- Both files are properly formatted and placed in the correct directory structure
